  I am so grateful for the incredible support my son and I have received from
  our speech therapist. My 9-year-old son is autistic and minimally speaking,
  and she has been a true blessing in our journey. She works with us both online
  and in person, guiding me through the use of his AAC device (the Avaz app) and
  helping him make great progress in communicating.


  She not only supports my son but also empowers me as a parent. She helps me plan RPM (Rapid Prompting Method) lessons, assists with behavior strategies, and provides valuable video feedback whenever I share videos of our home sessions. These feedbacks have helped me improve and feel more confident in working with him.


  What makes her truly exceptional is that she also collaborates with my son’s school teacher, providing training and suggestions to help him in the classroom setting. Thanks to her dedication, my son has made significant strides, especially with his communication through the Ava’s app.


  I highly recommend her to any family looking for a compassionate, knowledgeable, and committed speech therapist. She’s not just a therapist — she’s a true partner in my son’s journey.
