review: My 4-year-old son has shown remarkable improvement in his speech within
  just the first month of joining therapy with Hima. She is patient,
  professional, and truly understands how to work with young children. I’m very
  happy with the progress so far and highly recommend her to anyone looking for
  effective speech therapy for their child.
