content: I recently took my grandson to Bambino Therapy, and the session with
  Ms. Hima Nair was truly exceptional. She's an outstanding therapist with
  immense patience and kindness. Her thorough analysis of my grandson's
  difficulties was impressive, and the treatment she provided was highly
  effective. Additionally, she took the time to explain all the necessary
  follow-up care at home, which was incredibly helpful. I highly recommend Ms.
  Hima Nair and Bambino Therapy!
