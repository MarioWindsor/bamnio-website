content: Trainer Hima is a wonderful mentor and a therapist.She truly
  understands how to connect with children of all ages in the most engaging and
  enjoyable way. She trained my daughter so well in pronunciation—helping her
  articulate each letter clearly and confidently. She used to teach in a most
  effective and a fun way which my daughter liked most .I’m genuinely grateful
  for her guidance and care.
