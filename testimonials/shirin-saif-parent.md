content: Ms. Hima has been working with my son for over a year. She is a
  neurodiversity affirming practitioner, well-read and up-to-date in her field.
  Moreover, she is reliable, warm, and incredibly kind. She was quick to build
  rapport with my child. She prioritizes play-based therapy. I am fortunate to
  have her as my son's SLP.
