Ableism is so deeply ingrained into our social fabric that it feels like that is the correct way to be. It's been there for centuries, and it continues everywhere in families, society, and schools. People with disabilities face this attitude every day.

Let's understand what ableism is and try to bring a small change in the way we speak, be   more inclusive and  accepting.

1. Ableism is a thought process that holds the people with disabilities as nonexistent entities in the society, ignoring and overlooking them in social gatherings. 
2. Public places without ramps or wheelchair access, no quiet rooms, schools without sensory break areas.
3. Using ableist terms like 'crazy', 'stupid' and 'mad' for disabled people.
4. Excluding the people with disabilities in decisions that affect them.
5. Portrayal of disabled people in media as tragic, sad and inspirational in news stories and films.
 

**Ableist attitudes and phrases we need to speak up against -**

* Talking loudly to a disabled person 
* Denying a fair opportunity for participation.
* Act as if doing a favour by being friends with disabled.
* Not accepting their differences 
* Pitying them for their disability
* Oh! you don’t look disabled (autism is an invisible disability)
* You’re So Inspirational

**The schools**

The mainstream schools reject or ostracize the disabled as unfit to attend their schools. In special schools too, the non-verbal children are treated differently than the verbal.

**The society** 

The society at large tries to portray a sad picture of the disabled community, showing them as a person deserving pity.

**Families** 

The families where the neurodivergent children are compared to all their neurotypical peers and looked down upon. 

**What can be done by us to reduce ableism?** 

Families can support their disabled kin by accepting them as and how they are. 

1. Person first, then the disability. 
2. Respect and support them.
3. Speak up against ableist remarks.
4. Promote accessibility in all environments
5. Treat people with disabilities as equals.
6. Gently correct misconceptions about disabilities 
7. Amplify the voice of people with disabilities on social media and in conversations.

**“Breaking free from ableism starts with simple, everyday actions—choosing respectful language, advocating for accessibility, and honouring each person’s uniqueness. Together, families, schools, and communities can build a world where neurodivergent and disabled individuals are truly included, valued, and empowered to thrive. Let’s speak up, make space, and celebrate diversity in every part of life.”[[1](https://oxford-review.com/the-oxford-review-dei-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-dictionary/ableism-awareness-what-it-is-and-how-to-develop-it){:target="_blank"}][[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-ableism-its-impact-alan-s-gutterman-jd-dba-phd-u38vc){:target="_blank"}][[3](https://www.handtalk.me/en/blog/ableism/){:target="_blank"}]**
